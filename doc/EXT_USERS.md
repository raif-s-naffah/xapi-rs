# User Management Extension

This is a **`LARS`** specific xAPI resource extension that allows authorized administrators to manage users and their permissions.

The _Extension_ end-point base URL is `<LRS_EXTERNAL_URL>/extensions/users` where `LRS_EXTERNAL_URL` is the configured environment variable representing the external host address of the running server instance. For brevity purposes this "base" will be assumed to prefix the segment(s) associated to a handler. So if `/foo` is given, the full URL to invoke the action will be `<LRS_EXTERNAL_URL>/extensions/users/foo`. Also if the segment is simply `/` it is omitted.

For now it's just a placeholder.
