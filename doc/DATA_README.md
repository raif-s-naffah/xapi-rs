# `data` - Data structures

This module consists of Rust bindings for the [IEEE Std 9274.1.1][101], IEEE Standard for Learning Technologyâ€” JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) Data Model Format and Representational State Transfer (RESTful) Web Service for Learner Experience Data Tracking and Access.

The standard describes a JSON[^101] data model format and a RESTful[^102] Web Service API[^103] for communication between Activities experienced by an individual, group, or other entity and an LRS[^104]. The LRS is a system that exposes the RESTful Web Service API for the purpose of tracking and accessing experiential data, especially in learning and human performance.

In this project when i mention "xAPI" i mean the collection of published documents found [here](https://opensource.ieee.org/xapi>).

## The [`Validate`] trait

Types defined in this project rely on [`serde`][102] and a couple of other libraries to deserialize xAPI data. As they stand + Unit and Integration Tests for these types use the published [examples][103] to _partly_ ensure their correctness in at least they will consume the input stream and will produce instances of those types that can be later manipulated.

I said partly b/c not all the _rules_ specified by the specifications can or are encoded in the techniques used for unmarshelling the input data stream.

For example when xAPI specifies that a property must be an IRL the corresponding field is defined as an [`IriString`][104]. But an IRL is not just an IRI! As xAPI (3. Definitions, acronyms, and abbreviations) states...

> _...an IRL is an IRI that when translated into a URI (per the IRI to
> URI rules), is a URL._

Unfortunately the [`iri-string`][105] library does not offer out-of-the-box support for IRLs.

Another example of the limitations of solely relying on [`serde`][102] for instantiating _correct_ types is the email address (`mbox`) property of [Agent]s and [Group]s. xAPI (4.2.2.1 Actor) states that an `mbox` is a...

> _mailto IRI. The required format is "mailto:email address"._

For those reasons a [`Validate`] trait is defined and implemented to ensure that an instance of a type that implements this trait **is** valid, in that it satisfies the xAPI constraints, if + when it passes the `validate()` call.

If a `validate()` call returns `None` when it shouldn't it's a bug.


## Equality and Equivalence - The [`Fingerprint`] trait

There's the classical _Equality_ concept ubiquitous in software that deals w/ object Equality. That concept affects (in Rust) the `Hash`, `PartialEq` and `Eq` _Traits_. Ensuring that our xAPI Data Types implement those Traits mean they can be used as Keys in `HashMap`s and distinct elements in `HashSet`s.

The xAPI describes (and relies) on a concept of _Equivalence_ that determines if two instances of the same Data Type (say [Statement]s) are equal. That _Equivalence_ is **different** from _Equality_ introduced earlier. So it's possible to have two [Statement]s that have different `hash`[^12] values yet are _equivalent_. Note though that if two [Statement]s (and more generally two instances of the same Data Type) are **equal** then they're also **equivalent**.  In other words, _Equality_ implies _Equivalence_ but not the other way around.

To satisfy _Equivalence_ between instances of a Data Type i intoroduce a Trait named [Fingerprint]. The _required_ function of this Trait; i.e. [`fingerprint()`][crate::Fingerprint#fingerprint], is used to test for _Equivalence_ between two instances of the same Data Type.

For most xAPI Data Types, both the `hash` and `fingerprint` functions yield the same result. When they differ the _Equivalence_ only considers properties the xAPI standard qualifies as **_preserving immutability requirements_**, for example for [Statement]s those are...

* [Actor], except the ordering of Group members,
* [Verb], except for `display` property,
* [Object][107],
* Duration, excluding precisions beyond 0.01 second.

Note though that even when they yield the same result, the implementations take into consideration the following constraints --and hence apply the required conversions before the test for equality...

* Case-insensitive string comparisons when the property can be safely   compared this way such as the `mbox` (email address) of an [Actor] but   not the `name` of an [Account].
* IRI Normalization by first splitting it into _Absolute_ and _Fragment_ parts then [_normalizing_][108] the _Absolute_ part before hashing the two in sequence.


## The [`Canonical`] trait

xAPI requires LRS implementations to sometimes produce results in _canonical_ form --See [Language Filtering Requirements for Canonical Format Statements][109] for example.

This trait definees a method to be implemented by types required to produce such format

## Getters, Builders and Setters

Once a type is instantiated, access to any of its fields --sometimes referred to in the documentation as _properties_ using the _camel case_ form mostly used in xAPI-- is done through methods that mirror the Rust field names of the structures representing said types.

For example the _homePage_ property of an [Account] is obtained by calling the method `home_page()` of an [Account] instance which returns a reference to the IRI string as `&IriStr`.

Sometimes however it is convenient to access the field as another type. Using the same example as above, the [Account] implementation offers a `home_page_as_str()` which returns a reference to the same field as `&str`.

This pattern is generalized thoughtout the project.

The project so far, except for rare use-cases, does NOT offer setters for any type field. Creating new instances of types by hand --as opposed to deserializing (from the wire)-- is done by (a) instantiating a _Builder_ for a type, (b) calling the _Builder_ setters (using the same field names as those of the to-be built type) to set the desired values, and when ready, (c) calling the `build()` method.

_Builders_ signal the occurence of errors by returning a `Result` w/ the error part being a [DataError] instance (a variant of [MyError]). Here's an example...

```rust
# use core::result::Result;
# use xapi_rs::{Account, MyError};
# fn dummy() -> Result<(), MyError> {
    let act = Account::builder()
        .home_page("https://inter.net/login")?
        .name("example")?
        .build()?;
    // ...
    assert_eq!(act.home_page_as_str(), "https://inter.net/login");
    assert_eq!(act.name(), "example");
#     Ok(())
# }
```

## Naming

Naming properties in xAPI _Objects_ is inconsistent. Sometimes the singular form is used to refer to a collection of items; e.g. _member_ instead of _members_ when referring to a [Group]'s list of [Agent]s. In other places the plural form is correctly used; e.g. [_attachments_][Attachment] in a [SubStatement], or [_extensions_][Extensions] everywhere it's referenced.

I tried to be consistent in naming the fields of the corresponding types while ensuring that their serialization to, and deserialization from, streams respect the label assigned to them in xAPI and backed by the accompanying examples. So to access a [Group]'s [Agent]s one would call `members()`. To add an [Agent] to a [Group] one would call `member()` on a [GroupBuilder].
